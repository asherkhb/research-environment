# Research Environment

Research Environment provisions cloud resources for scientific research. 

A front-end application ("client") provides a user-friendly interface for requesing and accessing
resources, while a back-end application ("server") provides an API for provisioning and managing resources.

Currently, AWS is the only supported cloud provider.

## Quick Start

Docker makes launching the environment simple,

```
$ git clone $REPO
$ cd research-environment
$ docker-compose up
```
